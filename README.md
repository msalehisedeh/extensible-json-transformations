# Welcome to Extensible JSON transformations!
Have you ever wanted to perform query on a JSON?  Have you ever wanted to consume it in a program but the JSON was in a form not suitable for your program? Have you wanted to use the JSON without writing any code to do it? Have you wondered what it takes to make this happen? Well... wonder no more and add this component into your project...

**NOTE:** Starting with version 1.1.0 this library is compatible with Angular 6+.

**NOTE:** Starting with version 1.3.0 you need to import this library through @sedeh/extensible-json-transformations.
